everyone cries
everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
everyone falls
everybody dreams and doubts
got to keep dancing when the lights go out
how in the world i am going to see?
you as my brother
not my enemy?
'cause everyone hurts
everyone cries
everyone sees the color in each other's eyes
everyone loves
everybody gets their hearts ripped out
got to keep dancing when the lights go out
gonna keep dancing when the lights go out

hold tight for everyday life
at first light
throw my arms out open wide

no one knows them all
no high powered scholar
high paided by the hour

how is that we can make mass destruction
with one single bomb
but can't find a solution
to one simple problem
that has troubled us all
what is love 
i want to know, i just gotta know
why is it that
we can make smart computers 
that think for themselves
but can't make a computer
to match lonely people
with one thing in common
to fall in love with each other
what is love 
i want to know, i just gotta know
maybe one day they'll
make up a word that sums up love 
that won't be so complex 
and fits with the rest
but for now we are stuck
with this word and no luck

incapable
dunno how drunk and incapableturn left up the street
nothing but gray concrete and deadbeats
grab something to eat, mickey d's or kfc
only one choice in the city, don't voice in my pity
now let's get to the nitty gritty
june reminds me of my first ditty played unique
still 16 and feeling horny
point the sky and feel free
see, people are all equal
smiles are front and behind me
swim in the deep blue sea corn fields sway lazily
all smiles all easy
where ya from, what ya on and what's ya story?
mezmorizing tones rising pianos, this is my zone so stop cloning
pick paper scissors or stone 'cause me and you are the same
i known you all my life i don't know your name
(the name's european bob sordid, anyway)
we'll have a dance now see ya later
pleased to meet ya - likewise, a pleasure
we all smile
we all sing
the night slowly fades and goes slow motion
all the commotion becomes floating emotions
same piano loops over, arms wave eyes roll back
and jaws fall open, see it's a focus
enchanted is blocking the toilets
dizzy new heights blinded by the lights
these people are for life
so, back to his place at the end of the night
yo, they could settle wars with this
if only they will, imagine the world's leaders on pills
and imagine the morning after, falls causing disaster
don't talk to me i don't know ya, but this ain't tomorrow
for now i still love ya, hours fly over
sail around diamonds and pearls
never seen so many thick girls
discover new worlds, look at my watch can't focus
last two hours are lost every move fills me with lust
all of life's problems i just shake off
yo, mad little events happen
things might pan out in a few blue
maddens are like the toilets
big beefy bouncers out to reveal us
geezers aren't easy first timers
kids on wiz darlings on charlie
all come together for this party
all races many faces from places you never heard of
where ya from, what's ya name and what ya want?
sing to the words fecks to the fat ones
the tribal drums the sun's rising
we all smile
we all sing
then the girl in the cafe taps me on the shoulder
i realize five years went by and i'm older
memories smolder, winter's colder
but that same piano loops over and over and over
the road shines and the rain washes away
same chinese take-away selling shit in a tray
stalk all around i walk down same sights same sounds
new beats, though, solid concrete under my feet
no surprises no treats
the world stands still as my mind slushes around
the washer nut bolt in my crown
the life's been up and down since i walked from that crowd
we all smile
we all sing
out of respect for johnnie walker, paul oakenfold, nicky holloway
danny rampling and all the people who gave us these times
and to the government, i stick my middle finger up
with regards to the criminal justice bill
for all the heroes out and on the way
we all singhome, home in the late, night
and away, away in the half, life
except saturdays, crushed by the boring
and played and plagued by the tourists again
when once you had believed it
now you see it's sucking you in
to string you along with the pretense
and pave the way for the coming release
alone and prone in the half light
and late, late to the real life
if you find a way into the gold rush
you will stay until the morning

get innocuous!so many times have i asked you to tell me that i'm your girl.
'cause time after time i have needed a reason just to get inside your world.
so many times have i asked you to ask me how it feels to love.
and when this love seems the only conclusion that i'm guilty of, oh, baby, then 
you put your lovin' arms around me and it feels like shelter.
and you put your lovin' arms around me and inside your arms i'm burning.
put your lovin' arms around me.
and you whisper to me when you put your lovin' arms around me.
and inside this love i'm yearning.
 
sometimes the way that you act makes me wonder what i am to you.
and sometimes i can't stand the way that i'm acting 
to be part of the things you do.
often i've asked you for too much of your time; i'm stealing.
and when i dream of the fear that you're leaving, then i reach out.
my baby , then you put your lovin' arms around me and it feels like shelter.
and you put your lovin' arms around me and inside your arms i'm burning.

and inside this love i'm yearning, yearning, yearning.
inside this love i'm burning, burning, burning.

mess me up so good until i'm begging for more
you tear me apart like an animal
like an animal, animal
i know i'm getting close from the trail of broken hearts
hope she coming back to finish what she started
i never see the claws until she's touching me
she's holding me so tight it's getting hard to breath
i'll never win the game but it feels too good to care
you can take my heart like a criminal
(like a criminal, like a criminal)

i shut the world outside until the lights come on
maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
i feel my heart start beating to my favourite song
and all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
until monday morning feels another life
i turn the music up
i'm on a roll this time
and heaven is in sight
i turn the music up, i got my records on
from underneath the rubble sing a rebel song
don't want to see another generation drop
i'd rather be a comma than a full stop
maybe i'm in the black, maybe i'm on my knees
maybe i'm in the gap between the two trapezes
but my heart is beating and my pulses start
cathedrals in my heart
as we saw oh this light i swear you, emerge blinking into
to tell me it's alright
as we soar walls, every siren is a symphony
and every tear's a waterfall

when she was just a girl she expected the world
but it flew away from her reach and the bullets catch in her teeth
life goes on, it gets so heavy

one minute i held the key
next the walls were closed on me
and i discovered that my castles stand
upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman cavalry choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield
my missionaries in a foreign field
for some reason i can't explain
once you go there was never, never a honest word
and that was when i ruled the world
it was a wicked and wild wind
blew down the doors to let me in
shattered windows and the sound of drums
people couldn't believe what i'd become
revolutionaries wait
for my head on a silver plate
just a puppet on a lonely string
oh, who would ever want to be king?
i hear jerusalem bells are ringing
roman calvary choirs are singing
be my mirror, my sword and shield

or am i so jaded
i can't see or feel, like a man been tainted
numbed by the effect, aware of the muse
too in touch with myself, i light the fuse
i'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
i'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
as i light a bitter fuse
time is on loan, only ours to borrow
what i can't be today, i can be tomorrow
and the more i see, the more i know
the more i know, the less i understand.
i'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
i'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
to light a bitter fuse
it's a bigger part 
when our instincts act
a shot in the dark 
a movement in black
and the more i see, the more i know
the more i know, the less i understand.
i'm the changingman, built on shifting sands
(i don't have a plan)
i'm the changingman, waiting for the bang
to light a bitter fusei see double up ahead 
where the riverboat swayed beneath the sun

like a king who stalks the wings and shoots a dove 
and frees an eagle instead 
it's more or less the same as the things that you said
i see trouble up the road 
like the things you found in love are by the way 
and like to cheat on your soul 
like the best and worst of thoughts that lose control 
before you lie on your bed
it's more or less the same as the things that you said 
anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow 
anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red 
anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green 
and anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow
it's more or less the things you fail to say in your way that's your trouble 
like a king who stalks the wings and shoots the moon and the stars 
and his double 
it's more or less the same as the things that you said 
anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow 
anyway for all the things you said tell me why does the river run red 
anyway for all the things you've seen tell me when will the river run green 
and anyway for all the things you know tell me why does the river not flow

when she met her boyfriend michael 
he took her in his zephyr 
they sat like salt and pepper 
looking out across the city 
from lover's leap is pretty 
the lights they flick and flutter 
he told her how he loved her 
next night he called for her 
but dad protected daughter 
and told him she was poorly 
a lie was told there surely 
so michael felt rejected v this wasn't quite expected 
he drove off to his local 
where he felt anti-social 
she cried all night at missing 
the boy she could be kissing 
while he was falling over 
he drunk himself back sober 
and went home in a taxi 
and crashed out in the back seat 
he slept just like a baby 
which he hadn't done just lately 
he saw her in the morning 
out with his sister pauline 
she felt all shy and soppy 
he acted cool and cocky 
he said tonight at charlie's 
there's going to be a party 
i'll meet you at half seven 
she visualized the heaven 
if you ever change your mind 
which you do from time to time 
never chew a pickle 
with a little slap and tickle 
you have to throw the stone 
to get the pool to ripple 
that night they danced together 
it looked like love forever 
he put his hand on her leg 
you should have heard what she said 
he tried again much later 
it seemed to aggravate her 
he drove home in silence 
avoiding all violence 
she said let's watch the city 
from lover's leap is pretty 
i think i need the fresh air 
she put a comb through her hair 
then while she turned to kiss him 
and very nearly missed him 
she put her hand on his leg 
he felt her tongue in his head 
if you ever change your mind 
which you do from time to time 
never chew a pickle 
with a little slap and tickle 
you have to throw the stone 
to get the pool to rippleooh, it's so good, it's so good

glitter on the hallway 
the love shack is a little old place where we can get together
love shack baby! love shack, that's where it's at!
huggin' and a kissin', dancin' and a lovin', wearin' next to nothing

it ain't no big thing the toll of the bell
aggravated spare for days
i troll down town, the red light place
jump up bubble up, what's in store
love is the drug and i need to score
showing out, showing out hit and run
boy meets girl where the beat goes on
stitched up tight can't shake free
love is the drug got a hook on me
oh, catch that buzz
love is the drug i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug for me
oh, oh
late that night i parked my car
staked my place in the singles bar
face to face, toe to toe
heart to heart as we hit the floor
lumbered up limbo down
the locked embrace, stumble round
i say go, she says yes
dim the lights you can guess the rest
oh, catch that buzz
love is the drug i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug, got hookin' me
oh, catch that buzz
love is the drug i'm thinking of
oh, can't you see
love is the drug for me
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
oh, oh, oh, oh
love is, love is, love is the drugi can't stop the way i feel
things you do don't seem real
tell me what you've got in mind
'cause we're running out of time
won't you ever set me free?
this waiting 'round's killing me
she drives me crazy, like no one else
she drive me crazy, and i can't help myself
i can't get any rest
people say i'm obsessed
everything you say is lies
but to me that's no surprise
what i had for you was true
things go wrong, they always do
she drives me crazy, like no one else
she drive me crazy, and i can't help myself
i won't make it on my own
no one likes to be a lone
she drives me crazy, like no one else
she drive me crazy, and i can't help myself
she drives me crazy, like no one else
she drive me crazy, and i can't help myself
she drives me crazy, like no one else
she drive me crazy, and i can't help myselfbetter stop dreaming of the quiet life
cause it's the one we'll never know
and quit running for that runaway bus
cause those rosy days are few
and, stop apologizing for the things you've never done,
cause time is short and life is cruel
but it's up to us to change
this town called malice
rows and rows of disused milk floats
stand dying in the dairy yard
and a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk
bottles to their hearts
hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry
it's enough to make you stop believing when tears come
fast and furious
in a town called malice
struggle after struggle, year after year
the atmosphere's a fine blend of ice
i'm almost stone cold dead
in a town called malice
a whole street's belief in sunday's roast beef
gets dashed against the co-op
to either cut down on beer or the kids new gear
it's a big decision in a town called malice
the ghost of a steam train, echoes down my track
it's at the moment bound for nowhere
just going round and round
playground kids and creaking swings
lost laughter in the breeze
i could go on for hours and i probably will
but i'd sooner put some joy back
in this town called malicewhy make the past your sacred cow?
i guess you've changed, you've changed and how
yeah, yeah, yeah
fruit's grown rotten on the bough
reap what you sow, with a counterfeit plough
yeah, yeah, yeah
that was then but this is now
more sacrifices than an aztec priest
standing here straining at that leash
all fall down
can't complain, musn't grumble
help yourself to another peace of apple crumble
and consequently:
hearts of oak are charged and blistered
russians should be baby-sitted
americans enlisted
that was then but this is now

tammy baker's got a lot on her plate
can i buy another cheap picasso fake
andy warhol must be laughing in his grave
the band of the night take you to ethereal heights over dinner
you wander the streets never reaching the heights that you seek
and the sugar that dripped from the violins bow
made the children go crazy, put a hole in the tooth of a hag
can i have another piece of chocolate cake
tammy baker must be losing her faith
can i buy another cheap picasso fake
andy warhol must be laughing in his grave
and the dogs are on the road
we're all tempting fate
cars are shooting by
with no number plates
and here comes mrs. hairy legs
i saw elvis presley walk out of a seven eleven
and a woman gave birth to a baby and then bowled 257

will cushion the impact as you sink like a stone

you made me feel as though i was enough
we danced the night away, we drank too much
i held your hair back when
you were throwing up
then you smiled over your shoulder
for a minute, i was stone-cold sober
i pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me to stay over
i said, i already told ya
i think that you should get some rest
i knew i loved you then
but you'd never know
'cause i played it cool when i was scared of letting go
i know i needed you
but i never showed
but i wanna stay with you until we're grey and old
just say you won't let go
just say you won't let go
i'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
i'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
and i'll take the kids to school
wave them goodbye
and i'll thank my lucky stars for that night
when you looked over your shoulder
for a minute, i forget that i'm older
i wanna dance with you right now
oh, and you look as beautiful as ever
and i swear that everyday'll get better
you make me feel this way somehow
i'm so in love with you

tonighti'm walking away
from the troubles in my life
i'm walking away
oh, to find a better day
i'm walking away
from the troubles in my life
i'm walking away
oh, to find a better day
sometimes, some people get me wrong
when it's something i've said or done
sometimes, you feel there is no fun
that's why you turn and run
but now i truly realize
some people don't want to compromise
well i saw them with my own eyes
spreading those lies, yeah
well i don't want to live a lie
too many sleepless nights
not mentioning the fights
i'm sorry to say lady
i'm walking away
from the troubles in my life
i'm walking away
oh, to find a better day
well i'm so tired baby
of things you say
you're driving me away
whispers in the powder room baby
don't listen to the games they play
girl i thought you'd realized
i'm not like them other guys
'cause i saw them with my own eyes
you should've been more wise babe
well i don't want to live a lie
too many sleepless nights
not mentioning the fights
i'm sorry to say lady
i'm walking away
from the troubles in my life
i'm walking away
oh, to find a better day
i'm walking away
from the troubles in my life
i'm walking away
oh, to find a better dayi thought i saw a man brought to life
he was warm, he came around like he was dignified
he showed me what it was to cry
well you couldn't be that man i adored
you don't seem to know, don't seem to care
what your heart is for
no, i don't know him anymore
there's nothin' where we used to lie
conversation has run dry
that's what's going on
nothing's fine, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel, i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late
i'm already torn
so i guess the fortune teller's right
i should have seen just what was there
and not some holy light
but you crawled beneath my veins and now
i don't care, i have no luck
i don't miss it all that much
there's just so many things
that i can't touch, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel, i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
you're a little late
i'm already torn
torn
there's nothing where he used to lie
my inspiration has run dry
and that's what is goin' on
nothin's right, i'm torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel
i'm cold and i am shamed
lying naked on the floor
illusion never changed
into something real
i'm wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn
i'm all out of faith
this is how i feel, i'm cold and i'm ashamed
bound and broken on the floor
you're a little late
i'm already torn
torn
tornlightning strike
inside, my chest to keep me up at night
dream of ways
to make you understand my pain
[chorus]
clouds of sulfur in the air
bombs are falling everywhere
it's heartbreak warfare
once you want it to begin,
no one really ever wins
in heartbreak warfare
if you want more love,
why don't you say so?
if you want more love,
why don't you say so?
drop his name
push it in and twist the knife again
watch my face
as i pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain
[chorus]
just say so
how come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far i fall
god only knows how much i'd love you if you let me
but i can't break through at all.
it's a heart, heartbreak
i don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
let's just fix this whole thing now
i swear to god we're gonna get it right
if you lay your weapon down
red wine and ambien
you're talking shit again, it's heartbreak warfare
good to know it's all a game
disappointment has a name, it's heartbreak, heartbreak
it's heartbreak warfare
it's heartbreak warfare
it's heartbreak warfaremaking my way downtown walking fast
faces pass and i'm home bound
staring blankly ahead just making my way
making a way through the crowd
and i need you
and i miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass me by?
'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
if i could just see you tonight
it's always times like these when i think of you
and i wonder if you ever think of me
'cause everything's so wrong and i don't belong
living in your precious memories
'cause i'll need you
and i'll miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass me by?
'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
if i could just see you tonight
and i, i don't want to let you know
i, i drown in your memory
i, i don't want to let this go
i, i don't
making my way downtown walking fast
faces pass and i'm home bound
staring blankly ahead just making my way
making a way through the crowd
and i still need you
and i still miss you
and now i wonder
if i could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass us by?
'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
if i could just see you
if i could fall into the sky
do you think time would pass me by?
'cause you know i'd walk a thousand miles
if i could just see you, if i could just hold you tonightaren't you something to admire, 'cause your shine is something like a mirror
and i can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
if you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
just know that i'm always parallel on the other side
'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the glass, i'm here trying to pull you through
you just gotta be strong
'cause i don't wanna lose you now
i'm looking right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
coming back into you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me
i couldn't get any bigger
with anyone else beside of me
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
aren't you something, an original, 'cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
and i can't help but stare 'cause i see truth somewhere in your eyes
ooh i can't ever change without you, you reflect me, i love that about you
and if i could, i would look at us all the time
'cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
i can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
just put your hand on the glass, i'm here trying to pull you through
you just gotta be strong
'cause i don't wanna lose you now
i'm looking right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
coming back into you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me
i couldn't get any bigger
with anyone else beside of me
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
yesterday is history
tomorrow's a mystery
i can see you looking back at me
keep your eyes on me
baby, keep your eyes on me
i don't wanna lose you now
i'm looking right at the other half of me
the vacancy that sat in my heart
is a space that now you hold
show me how to fight for now
and i'll tell you, baby, it was easy
coming back into you once i figured it out
you were right here all along
it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me
i couldn't get any bigger
with anyone else beside of me
and now it's clear as this promise
that we're making two reflections into one
'cause it's like you're my mirror
my mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
you are you are the love of my life 
now you're the inspiration for this precious song
and i just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
so now i say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
and i can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
just to let you know, you are
you are you are the love of my life 
girl you're my reflection, all i see is you
my reflection, in everything i do
you're my reflection and all i see is you
my reflection, in everything i do
you are you are the love of my lifesometimes, i feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
and i can't help but ask myself how much i'll let the fear
take the wheel and steer
it's driven me before
and it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
but lately i am beginning to find
that i should be the one behind the wheel
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there, i'll be there
so if i decide to waiver my chance
to be one of the hive
will i choose water over wine
and hold my own and drive?
it's driven me before
and it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around
but lately i am beginning to find
that when i drive myself my light is found
so whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there, i'll be there
would you choose water over wine
hold the wheel and drive?
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there with open arms and open eyes
whatever tomorrow brings
i'll be there, i'll be therea lonely mother gazing out of her window
staring at a son that she just can't touch
if at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
but he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
but all the praying just ain't helping at all
'cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
so, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how
another body laying cold in the gutter
listen to me
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
but he just can't see
she give him loving that his body can't handle
but all he can say is, "baby, it's good to me"
one day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
but he doesn't recognize his own face
his health is fading and he doesn't know why
three letters took him to his final resting place
y'all don't hear me
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
i seen rainbow yesterday
but too many storms have come and gone
leavin' a trace of not on god-given ray
is it because my life is ten shades of gray
i pray all ten fade away
seldom praise him for the sunny days
and like his promise is true
only my faith can undo
the many chances i blew
to bring my life to anew
clear blue and unconditional skies
have dried the tears from my eyes
no more lonely cries
my only bleedin' hope
is for the folk who can't cope
wit such an endurin' pain
that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
who's to blame
for tootin' caine in your own vein
what a shame
you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
you claim the insane
and name this day in time
for fallin prey to crime
i say the system got you victim to your own mind
dreams are hopeless aspirations
in hopes of comin' true
believe in yourself
the rest is up to me and you
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fast
don't go chasing waterfalls
please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
i know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
but i think you're moving too fastyou tell all the boys no
makes you feel good yeah
i know you're out of my league
but that won't scare me away oh no
you've carried on so long
you couldn't stop if you tried it
you've built your wall so high
that no one could climb it
but i'm gonna try
would you let me see beneath your beautiful
would you let me see beneath your perfect
take it off now girl, take it off now girl
i wanna see inside
would you let me see beneath your beautiful tonight

behind your broadway show

that no one could climb it
but i'm gonna try
would you let me see beneath your beautiful

or tell you that
but if i didn't say it, well i'd still have felt it
where's the sense in that?
i promise i'm not trying to make your life harder
or return to where we were
i will go down with this ship
and i won't put my hands up and surrender
there will be no white flag above my door
i'm in love and always will be
i know i left too much mess and
destruction to come back again
and i caused nothing but trouble
i understand if you can't talk to me again
and if you live by the rules of it's over
then i'm sure that that makes sense
i will go down with this ship
and i won't put my hands up and surrender
there will be no white flag above my door
i'm in love and always will be
and when we meet
which i'm sure we will
all that was there
will be there still
i'll let it pass
and hold my tongue
and you will think
that i've moved on
i will go down with this ship
and i won't put my hands up and surrender
there will be no white flag above my door
i'm in love and always will be
i will go down with this ship
and i won't put my hands up and surrender
there will be no white flag above my door
i'm in love and always will be
i will go down with this ship
and i won't put my hands up and surrender
there will be no white flag above my door
i'm in love and always will beand so it goes another lonely day
you're savin' time but you're miles away
your flowers drowning in some bitter tea
for seeing lost opportunity

and see the talent you always hide

your only fear is possibility
never wonder what the hell went wrong
your second chance may never come along
hold on now your exits here

that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you? 
well it goes like this :
the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
 
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
 
well your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight over through ya
she tied you to her kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
 
baby i've been here before
i've seen this room and i've walked this floor
i used to live alone before i knew ya
i've seen your flag on the marble arch
but love is not a victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
there was a time when you let me know
what's really going on below
but now you never show that to me do ya
but remember when i moved in you
and the holy dove was moving too
and every breath we drew was hallelujah
 
well, maybe there's a god above
but all i've ever learned from love
was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
it's not a cry that you hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
 
hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujahstep one, you say we need to talk
he walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk
he smiles politely back at you
you stare politely right on through
some sort of window to your right
as he goes left, and you stay right
between the lines of fear and blame
you begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong?
i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
let him know that you know best
cause after all, you do know best
try to slip past his defense
without granting innocence
lay down a list of what is wrong
the things you've told him all along
and pray to god he hears you
and i pray to god he hears you
where did i go wrong?
i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
as he begins to raise his voice
you lower yours and grant him one last choice
drive until you lose the road
or break with the ones you've followed
he will do one of two things
he will admit to everything
or he'll say he's just not the same
and you'll begin to wonder why you came
where did i go wrong?
i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
where did i go wrong?
i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
how to save a life
how to save a life
where did i go wrong?

somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night

where did i go wrong?
i lost a friend
somewhere along in the bitterness
and i would have stayed up with you all night
had i known how to save a life
how to save a life
how to save a lifei can't stand to fly
i'm not that naive
i'm just out to find
the better part of me
i'm more than a bird, i'm more than a plane
i'm more than some pretty face beside a train
and it's not easy to be me
i wish that i could cry
fall upon my knees
find a way to lie
about a home i'll never see
it may sound absurd, but don't be naive
even heroes have the right to bleed
i may be disturbed, but won't you concede
even heroes have the right to dream
and it's not easy to be me
up, up and away, away from me
well, it's all right, you can all sleep sound tonight
i'm not crazy or anything
i can't stand to fly
i'm not that naive
men weren't meant to ride
with clouds between their knees
i'm only a man in a silly red sheet
digging for kryptonite on this one way street
only a man in a funny red sheet
looking for special things inside of me
inside of me
inside me
inside me
inside of me
i'm only a man
in a funny red sheet
i'm only a man
looking for a dream
i'm only a man
in a funny red sheet
and it's not easy
it's not easy to be mea few questions that i need to know
how you could ever hurt me so
i need to know what i've done wrong
and how long it's been going on
was it that i never paid enough attention?
or did i not give enough affection?
not only will your answers keep me sane
but i'll know never to make the same mistake again
you can tell me to my face or even on the phone
you can write it in a letter, either way, i have to know
did i never treat you right?
did i always start the fight?
either way, i'm going out of my mind
all the answers to my questions
i have to find
my head's spinning
boy, i'm in a daze
i feel isolated
don't wanna communicate
i'll take a shower, i will scour
i will rub
to find peace of mind
the happy mind i once owned, yeah
flexing vocabulary runs right through me
the alphabet runs right from a to z
conversations, hesitations in my mind
you got my conscience asking questions that i can't find
i'm not crazy
i'm sure i ain't done nothing wrong, no
i'm just waiting
'cause i heard that this feeling
won't last that long

i was running from my brother and his friends
and tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass i rolled down
i was younger then, take me back to when i
found my heart and broke it here
made friends and lost them through the years
and i've not seen the roaring fields in so long, i know i've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at ninety down those country lanes
singing to "tiny dancer"
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
had my first kiss on a friday night, i don't reckon that i did it right
but i was younger then, take me back to when
we found weekend jobs, when we got paid
we'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
but i can't wait to go home
i'm on my way
driving at ninety down those country lanes
singing to "tiny dancer"
and i miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
one friend left to sell clothes
one works down by the coast
one had two kids but lives alone
one's brother overdosed
one's already on his second wife
one's just barely getting by
but these people raised me and i can't wait to go home
and i'm on my way, i still remember
this old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

like floating in the ocean
people need the poison
three a.m., you just touched my hand
and made me lose my focus
i almost didn't notice
and i better know what to do
who's gonna be the first one to move?
i wanna get closer to you
and i better know what to do
who's gonna be the first one to move?
i wanna get closer to you

four a.m., almost touching you
drowning out the noises
in between the voices

you are getting closer in slow motionfixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water, hoping for the rain
up and up
up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
up and up
up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it's in your blood
it's in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up
up and up, it's saying
we're gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
whoa
we're gonna get it, get it together i know
gonna get it, get it together and flow
gonna get it, get it together and go
up and up and up
lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
up and up 
up and up
how come people suffer, how come people part?
how come people struggle
how come people break your heart?
break your heart, oh
yes i wanna grow, yes i wanna feel
yes i wanna know
show me how to heal it up
heal it up
oh, see the forest there in every seed
angels in the marble waiting to be freed
just need love, just need love
when the going is rough, saying
we're gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
whoa
we're gonna get it, get it together i know
gonna get it, get it together and flow
gonna get it, get it together and go
and you can say what is, or fight for it
close your mind and take a risk

niente triplette

as a guidefixing up a car to drive in it again
searching for the water, hoping for the rain
up and up
up and up
down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
up and up
up and up
see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
see a bird soaring high above the flood
it's in your blood
it's in your blood
underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
sitting with the poison takes away the pain
up and up
up and up, it's saying

gonna get it, get it together and flower
whoa

lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
up and up 
up and up

how come people struggle
how come people break your heart?
break your heart, oh

or see each sunrise as a gift
we're gonna get it, get it together right now
gonna get it, get it together somehow
gonna get it, get it together and flower
whoa

see the lines around my eyes,

your life's a mess, you've been cut adrift
you'd better smile 
i feel like a dalek inside,
everything's gone grey but used to be so black and white
see the lines around my eyes,

before we all go under
and fade out again and fade out again
cracked eggs, dead birds
scream as they fight for life
i can feel death, can see its beady eyes
all these things into position
all these things we'll one day swallow whole
fade out again

your dry blood on my fingertip
running down corridors

trying to make myself a sail
then i'll float to you my darlin'
with the evening on my tail
although not the most honest means of travel
it gets me there nonetheless
i'm a heartless man at worst, babe
and a helpless one at best
darling i'll bathe your skin
i'll even wash your clothes
just give me some candy
before i go
oh, darling i'll kiss your eyes
and lay you down on your rug
just give me some candy
after my heart
oh, and i'm often false explaining
but to her it plays out all the same
and although i'm left defeated
it gets held against my name
i know you got plenty to offer baby
but i guess i've taken quite enough
well i'm some stain there on your bed sheet
you're my diamond in the rough
darling i'll bathe your skin
i'll even wash your clothes
just give me some candy
before i go
oh, darling i'll kiss your eyes
and lay you down on your rug
just give me some candy
after my heart
i know that there's writings on the wall
but darling i'll bathe your skin
i'll even wash your clothes
just give me some candy
before i go 
oh, darling i'll kiss your eyes
and lay you down on your rug
just give me some candy
after my heart
oh and i'll be there waiting for you
know that i'll be there waiting for you
oh i'll be there waiting for you
oh, i'll be there waiting for you
oh, i'll be there waiting for you
oh, i'll be there waiting for you
i'll be there waiting for you (all the cutthroats and their jagged ends)
(all of them have got me waiting and waiting)
oh, then i'll be there waiting on you (all the cheap and their sugary philosophies)
(have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting)
i'll be there waiting for you (all the angels and their halos)
i'll be there waiting for you (all of them have got me waiting and waiting)
i'll be there waiting for you (all the cutthroats and their jagged ends)
(all of them have got me waiting and waiting)
i'll be there waiting for you (all the cheap and their sugary philosophies)
(have got me on the fence just waiting and waiting)
i'll be there waiting for you (all the angels and their halos)
(all of they do is keep me waiting and waiting)just yesterday morning, they let me know that you were gone.
suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you.
i walked out this morning and i wrote down this song,
i just can't remember who to send it to.
i've seen fire and i've seen rain.
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end.
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend,
but i always thought that i'd see you again.
won't you look down upon me, jesus,
you've got to help me make a stand.
you've just got to see me through another day.
my body's aching and my time is at hand
and i won't make it any other way.
oh, i've seen fire and i've seen rain.
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end.
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend,
but i always thought that i'd see you again.
been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun.
lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around.
well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come.
sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground.
oh, i've seen fire and i've seen rain.
i've seen sunny days that i thought would never end.
i've seen lonely times when i could not find a friend,
but i always thought that i'd see you baby, one more time again, now.
thought i'd see you one more time again.
there's just a few things coming my way this time around, now.
thought i'd see you, thought i'd see you, fire and rain, now.in one single moment your whole life can turn around, i stand there for a minute staring straight into the ground.
looking to the left slightly then looking back down the world feels like its caved in proper sorry frown. 
please let me show you how we could only just be for us, i can change and i can grow or we can adjust. the wicked thing about us is we always have trust. 
we can even have an open relationship if we must. 
i look at her, she stares almost straight back at me but her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me. 
then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity, when they opened up she's lookin down at her feet.
[chorus]
dry your eyes mate, i know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
there's plenty more fish in the sea.
dry your eyes mate, i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
so then i moved my hand off and down by my side, shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes.
i turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies, touched the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh.
because i can't imagine my life without you and me, there's things i can't imagine doing, things i can't imagine seeing.
it weren't supposed to be easy, surely, please please, i'm begging, please.
she brings her hands up towards where my hands rested she wraps her fingers around mine with the softness she's blessed with.
she peels away my fingers looks at me and then gestures, by pushing my hand away to my chest from hers.
[chorus]
dry your eyes mate, i know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
there's plenty more fish in the sea.
dry your eyes mate, i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
and i'm just standing there.
i can't say a word.
'cause everything has just gone.
i've got nothing.
absolutely nothing.
trying to pull her close out of bare desperation, put my arms around her to try to change what she's saying.
put my head level with hers so she might engage in.
look into her eyes to make her listen again, i'm not gonna fuckin' just fuckin' just leave it all now.
'cause you said it would be forever and that was your vow, and your gonna let our things simply crash and fall down.
your well out of order now, this is well out of town.
she pulls away, my arms that are tightly clamped around her waist gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight.
turns around so she's now got her back to my face, takes one step forward, looks back and then walks away.
[chorus]
dry your eyes mate, i know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
there's plenty more fish in the sea.
dry your eyes mate, i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now, its over.
i know in the past i've found it hard to say, telling you things but not telling you straight. but the more i pull on your hand the more you pull away.
dry your eyes mate, i know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up.
there's plenty more fish in the sea.
dry your eyes mate, i know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts, but you've got to walk away now.why do you come here?
and why do you hang around?
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me?
when you know, oh
why do you come?
why do you telephone? (hmm...)
and why send me silly notes?
i'm so sorry
i'm so sorry
why do you come here
when you know it makes things hard for me?
when you know, oh
why do you come?
you had to sneak into my room
just to read my diary
"it was just to see, just to see"
(all the things you knew i'd written about you...)
oh, so many illustrations
oh, but
i'm so very sickened
oh, i am so sickened now
oh, it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh
it was a good lay, good lay
it was a good lay, good lay
oh, it was a good lay, good lay
oh
oh, it was a good lay
it was a good lay
oh, a good lay
oh, it was a good lay
good lay, good lay
oh
it was a good lay
it was a good layi feel so extraordinary
something's got a hold on me
i get this feeling i'm in motion
a sudden sense of liberty
i don't care 'cause i'm not there
and i don't care if i'm here tomorrow
again and again i've taken too much
of the things that cost you too much
i used to think that the day would never come
i'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
my morning sun is the drug that brings me near
to the childhood i lost, replaced by fear
i used to think that the day would never come
that my life would depend on the morning sun...
when i was a very small boy,
very small boys talked to me
now that we've grown up together
they're afraid of what they see
that's the price that we all pay
and the value of destiny comes to nothing
i can't tell you where we're going
i guess there was just no way of knowing
i used to think that the day would never come
i'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
my morning sun is the drug that brings me near
to the childhood i lost, replaced by fear
i used to think that the day would never come
that my life would depend on the morning sun...
i feel so extraordinary
something's got a hold on me
i get this feeling i'm in motion
a sudden sense of liberty
the chances are we've gone too far
you took my time and you took my money
now i fear you've left me standing
in a world that's so demanding
i used to think that the day would never come
i'd see delight in the shade of the morning sun
my morning sun is the drug that brings me near
to the childhood i lost, replaced by fear
i used to think that the day would never come
that my life would depend on the morning sun...when routine bites hard
and ambitions are low
and resentment rides high
but emotions won't grow
and we're changing our ways
taking different roads
love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again
why is the bedroom so cold?
turned away on your side
is my timing that flawed?
our respect run so dry?
yet there's still this appeal
that we've kept through our lives
but love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again
do you cry out in your sleep?
all my failings exposed
gets a taste in my mouth
as desperation takes hold
and it's something so good
just can't function no more?
love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear us apart again
love, love will tear up apart againi looked into my baby's eyes

it's coming!" 
when i was a child: 
running in the night, 
afraid of what might be 
hiding in the dark, 
hiding in the street, 
and of what was following me... 
now hounds of love are hunting. 
i've always been a coward, 
and i don't know what's good for me. 
here i go! 
it's coming for me through the trees. 
help me, someone! 
help me, please! 
take my shoes off, 
and throw them in the lake, 
and i'll be 
two steps on the water. 
i found a fox 
caught by dogs. 
he let me take him in my hands. 
his little heart, 
it beats so fast, 
and i'm ashamed of running away 
from nothing real-- 
i just can't deal with this, 
but i'm still afraid to be there, 
among your hounds of love, 
and feel your arms surround me. 
i've always been a coward, 
and never know what's good for me. 
oh, here i go! 
don't let me go! 
hold me down! 
it's coming for me through the trees. 
help me, darling, 
help me, please! 
take my shoes off 
and throw them in the lake, 
and i'll be 
two steps on the water. 
i don't know what's good for me. 
i don't know what's good for me. 
i need your love love love love love, yeah! 
your love! 
take your shoes off 
and throw them in the lake! 
do you know what i really need? 
do you know what i really need? 
i need love love love love love, yeah!you burden me with your questions
you'd have me tell no lies
you're always asking what it's all about, darlin' listen to my replies
you say to me i don't talk enough
but when i do i'm a fool
these times i've spent, i've realized
i'm going to shoot through and leave you
the things, you say
your purple prose just gives you away
the things, you say
you're unbelievable (what the f*ck?)
you burden me with your problems
by telling me more about mine
i'm always so concerned
with the way you say you've always go to stop to think of us
being one is more than i ever know
but this time, i realize i'm going to shoot through and leave you
the things, you say
your purple prose just gives you away
the things, you say
you're unbelievable (what the f*ck?)
seemingly lastless, don't mean you can ask us
pushing down the relative, bringing out your higher self
think of the fine times, pushing down the better few
instead of bringing out the clues
to what the world and everything you answer to
brace yourself with the grace of ease
i know this world ain't what it seems (what the f*ck? whoa man!)
it's unbelievable
you burden me with your questions
you'd have me tell no lies
you're always asking what it's all about, darlin' listen to my replies
you say to me i don't talk enough
but when i do i'm a fool
these times i've spent, i've realized
i'm going to shoot through and leave you
the things you say
your purple prose just gives you away
the things you say
is for what i love you more

where things bend and break
and shake to the rule

i would shed my skin for you
talking fast on the edge of nothing
i would break my back for you
don't know why, don't know why
things vaporize and rise to the sky
and we tried so hard
and we looked so good
and we lived our lives in black
but something about you felt like pain
you were my sunny day rain
you were the clouds in the sky
you were the darkest sky
but your lips spoke gold and honey
that's why i'm happy when it rains
i'm happy when it pours
looking at me enjoying something
that feels like feels like pain
to my brain
and if i tell you something
you take me back to nothing
i'm on the edge of something
you take me back
and i'm happy when it rainsby, oh by, the way of an explanation

helplessly helping all the rules 
and there was a boy at school 
hopelessly wrestling all his fools 
and there was a girl at school 
blaming all the words she stole from home 
nothing would keep her a child 
long hours don't ? though we try 
we try but we don't have long 
we try but we don't belong 
we try but we didn't have long 
we try but we didn't belong

helplessly breaking rules we meet 
life's unfound ? and love's ?
say goodbye to nothing everything caused 
now i need you on my street 
hopelessly breaking rules we meet 
love's unfound ? and love's ?
say goodbye to everything, nothing caused"everybody be cool, this is a robbery!"
"any of you fucking pricks move
and i'll execute every motherfucking last one of you!"
me and fast got the gats, we're out to rob a bank 
we got steve outside, carrying a full pack 
now everything's cool and everthing's smooth 
i walked up to the teller, i gave her the letter 
she gave me the loot with puckered up lips 
and a wink that i found cute, and i said,
"baby, baby, baby"
(is this some kharmic-chi love thing happening here baby or what) 
by that time fast tapped me with the nine
he said it's time to blow, ya know, so out the door we go 
back to the ride with steve inside and alive, off we drive 
see, i hurt my lower lumbar, you know we'll never get far
riding around in a stolen police car
so we dropped it off and piled in a caddy 
steve was driving 'cause i had to talk to my man about something 
"look, i don't know anything about any fucking set-up
you can torture me all you want"
"torture you, that's good, that's a good idea, i like that one"
running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
running around robbing banks
all whacked off of scooby snacks
and i don't give a f*ck about the hell's gate
ain't punkin' the crowd and i'm still standing up straight
so, we pull these jobs to make a little money
no one gets hurt if they don't act funny
on the way to the yacht, we almost got caught
fast is shooting mailboxes, not knowing where the cop is, yeah
they're at the dunkin donuts, adjacent from the fromans
whose mailbox fast had just exploded
they gave chase, but my man steve's an ace
and we lost those brothers with haste
we casted off and along we went
off bermuda to an island resort we rented
"sonny, i need you cool
"are you cool?"
"i am cool"

while you read to me from the right, act way on high, high
clutching a crisp new testament, breathing fire, fire
will you save me the fake benevolence, i don't have time, i'm
just too far gone for a-tellin', lost my pride, i don't mind
being holy, so leave me alone
aw, you're acting all holy, me, i'm just full of holes
well i can dip my head in the river
cleanse my soul, oh
i'll still have the stomach of a sinner
face like an unholy ghost
will you save me all the soliloquies
paid my fines, i'll be
gone before my deliverance
preach what you write, 'cause i don't mind
being holy, so leave me alone
you're acting all holy, 
me, i'm just full of holes, full of holes
don't mind being lonely, so spare me the brimstone
acting all holy, when you know i'm full of holes
don't mind being lonely, don't need to be told
stop acting so holy, 
i know i'm full of holes, full of holes
i don't mind being lonely, so leave me alone
are you, oh, so holy, that i'll never be good enough
don't care if i'm lonely, 'cause it feels like home
i won't ever be holy, thank god i'm full of holes, full of holesthere was a boy who ran away
from what he didn't know
who he wouldn't say
he just had to go
something had snapped inside of him
as he fled from a nameless threat
crowds of people stand aloof in waterloo
there's no sunset
sunset
and when he gets to this mythic place
the streets are dirty dark and deep
there is no rest
there is no place to lay a head
to sleep
to sleep
to sleep
to sleep
there was a boy who ran away
from what he didn't know
who he wouldn't say
he just had to go
go!
went to so much trouble
to banish you from my sight
he said that you're an accident
an accident about which
i should forget
forget
forget
forget
and now that the wheel has gone around
he's back where he belongs
and he knows there is no hope
only

when we're struggling to think straight

last night's love affair is looking vulnerable in my bed
silk sheet, blue dawn, colgate, tongue warm
won't you quit your crying? i can't sleep
one minute i'm a little sweetheart
and next minute you are an absolute creep
we've got obsessions
i want to wipe out all the sad ideas 
that come to me when i am holding you
we've got obsessions
all you ever think about are sick ideas 
involving me, involving you
supermarket, oh what packet of crackers to pick?
they're all the same, one brand, one name, but really they're not
look, look, just choose something quick
people are staring, time ticker-quicking
cheeks are on fire; just choose something, something, something
pressure overwhelming
next minute i am turning out of the door, facing one week without food
a day, a day when things are pretty bad
don't let it make you feel sad, 
the crackers were probably bad luck anyway
can't let your cold heart be free
when you act like you've got an ocd
we've got obsessions
i want to erase every nasty thought 
that bugs me every day of every week
we've got obsessions
you never tell me what it is that mades you strong 
and what it is that mades you weak
we've got obsessions
i want to erase every nasty thought 
that bugs me every day of every week
we've got obsessions
you never told me what it was that made you strong 
and what it was that made you weak
mades you weak, mades you weak
made you weak, made you weak, made you weak
made you
sunday, wake up, give me a cigarette
last night's love affair is looking vulnerable againtake it back or let me go
it's better if i tell you so
i hurt you once before and i will do it again
everyone i know is gone and i don't even know myself 
i'm saving up
to take a trip to mexico 
i heard it's the place to go
oh i want to see the colours of another sky
carry me home on your shoulders
lower me onto my bed 
show me the night that i dreamed about before 
ohh ohh 
lover you may cause me tears
drag me through the best of years
you never know
many of the songs i wrote
older than a year or two
but i love you so 
oh, carry me home on your shoulders
lower me onto my bed
show me the night that i dreamed about before 
carry me home on your shoulders
lower me onto my bed
show me the night that i dreamed about before 
ohh
lover you may cause me tears 
drag me through the best of years
but i love you sodaniel, when i first saw you
i knew that you had a flame in your heart
and under wild blue skies
marlboro ruby skies
i found a home in your eyes
and we'd never be apart
and when the fires came
the smell of cinders and rain
perfumed almost everything
we laughed and laughed and laughed
and in the golden blue
car you took me to
the darkest place you knew
set fire to my heart
when i run in the dark
daniel
into a place that's vast
daniel
under a sheet of rain in my heart
daniel
i dream of home
but in a goodbye bed
with my arms around your neck
into our mouths our tears crept
just kids in the eye of the storm
and as the house spun round
my dreams pulled me from the ground
forever to search for the faith
for home again
for home againoh i beg you, can i follow?
oh i ask you, why not always?
