Seen them come and go, one switch, they not gold
No house no mo', not even a condo
As long as I know how to love, I'm a stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me 'cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin' down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'm a get paid in a big way, survivor!

You know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun
It's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinkin' bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love 'em
And you really know
Everything that used to matter, it don't matter no more

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth

Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room

Find my way back into you

Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I want to try again

Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse

'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes

I do what it takesWe've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist, singing

Oops I did it again, I
Forgot what I was losing my mind about
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message, "I was young and a menace"

Young, young, young and a menace

Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived

Oops I, did it again, I
Forgot what I was losing my mind about
I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message, "I was young and a menace"

Young, young, young and a menace

I'm just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the, for the

Clean cop, clean cop, fucking with that dirty cop

Clean cop, clean cop, rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna' act proud as peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Motherfucker' tryna blow me out my Reebox 
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop them down, when these bitches tryna lock me down
Hit the ground, hit the turf, walk the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse, that make your ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West coast, war lord
Blacker, than the black knight
F*ck a black and white, the winner ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sister off course
While these motherfuckers chill on the golf course

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop

Lazy cop, fuckin' with that crazy cop

Tell the truth cop, with that true or lie cop
Bro you fuckin' high cop, don't even try cop

All you find in my closet is the high top
And my motherfuckin' tickets to the sky box
Hold up nigga, I'm a rider

Hell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, motherfuck the blue code
F*ck the po-po actin' like Deebo

Black Lives Matter, it's not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black copDancing on the crumbling precipice
The rocks are coming loose just at the edge
Are we laughing? Are we crying?
Are we drowning? Are we dead?
Or is it all a dream?

The bombs are getting closer everyday
"That can never happen here" we used to say
Have these wars come to our doorstep?
Has this moment finally come?
Or is it all a dream?

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough
Or is it all a dream?

To a predetermined fate are we condemned
Or maybe we're a book without an end
We're not stories, we're not actors
We're awake and in control 
And this is not a dream

So can we break this mold
And set in motion something new
Forgetting what we know
An evolution overdue 
Fight the current
Pull the ripcord
Get away! 

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good, good enough?

We travel back to what we take
We need a storm, let's pray for rain now
To wash these roads away
Let's get off track and wander far
Same roads lead to same destinations 
Follow nothing but your heart
We're talking in our sleep 
And sleeping through our lives
We dream of the places where we never die
We step from our shadows and into the light 

Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Is the violence in our nature
Just the image of our maker?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
To become something greater
Than the violence in our nature?
Are we not good enough?
Are we not brave enough?
Are we not good, good enough?
Or was it all a dream?Don't call it a comeback 
I've been here for years 
I'm rocking my peers 
Puttin' suckers in fear 
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon 
Listen to the bass go boom 
Explosions, overpowerin' 
Over the competition I'm towerin' 
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics 
that'll make you call the cops 
Don't you dare stare, you better move 
Don't ever compare 
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced 
Competition's payin' the price

Why do you riff with me 
The maniac psycho 
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 
Cause I might go Blaw!

The ripper will not allow 
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,

Feeding on chaos
And living in sin
Downward spiral where do I begin?

Finding nothing but questions and devils

You know the truth can be a weapon
To fight this world of ill intentions
A new answer to the same question
How many times will you learn the same lesson?

Could never turn back now

Till you show me what this life is for

Building a case for eviction
Circling
Guarding a tower of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience
And patiently circling

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don't have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is forSo this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I amI took a walk on a Saturday night,
Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.In the morning light let my roots take flight
Watch me from above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I never have to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming

Hey yeah, tiptoe higherI'm sorry, mother I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine
No these days I tend to lie
I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down
Well, these days you're fine
No these days you tend to lie
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short

I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up shortTry to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice

Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe

Every night every night every night every night

I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your head
It ruffles you up
You could find the reason
You could let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

Searching to find myself
And all I find is you

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on

And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you made it, when you made it
Won't ya tell me what to do
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating

'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now

When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off

Oh why can't you let go
Like a bird in the snow
This is no place to build your home

You can't fight the friction
So ease it off
Can't take the pressure
So ease it off
Don't tell me to be strong
Ease it off
You can't fight the friction
So yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah4 A.M. beside myself
And what I think of mental health
All the things that worry me
All the things you don't believe
I've been told just what to do
Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be
I think I learned in therapy
Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you, it comes back to you
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you
It comes back to you, it comes back to you
Looking back into the past and I can see it through
(Tu lu tu tu tu du tu du tu tu)
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes back to you

Mocking birds and diamond rings
Oh I have thought of greater things
All the things that fly by me
All the lives that I could lead
Maybe I was born for that
Or maybe I was first to last
You could call it cowardliness
But leave me to my studied bliss
Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you, it comes back to you
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you
It comes back to you, it comes back to you
Looking back into the past and I can see it through
(Tu lu tu tu tu du tu du tu tu)
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back youIn the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream

In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess

I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I can poison the skies
And I, I feel so alive

Nobody can save you now
King is crown, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now

Everything inside of me,
Just wanted to fit in (Oh oh oh oh)
I was never one for pretenders,
Everything I tried to be,
Just wouldn't settle in (Oh oh oh oh)

If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because,
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a chamber who's got me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger.

Can I clear my conscience,
If I'm different from the rest,
Do I have to run and hide? (Oh oh oh oh)
I never said that I want this,
This burden came to me,
And it's made it's home inside (Oh oh oh oh)

If I told you what I was,

Up in the evening,
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.
Oh, to me.

Up on the mountain,
Down in the king's lair,
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.
Oh, afternoon.

We were never welcome here,
We were never welcome here at all.
No.

It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.

Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.

Up in the attic,
Down in the cellar,
Lost in a static,
Coming back for more.
Oh, for more.

Out with the reason,
In with the season,
Taking down names in my book of jealousy.
Jealousy.

We were never welcome here.
We were never welcome here at all.
No.

It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.

Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.

Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.

Why won't you save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Upping the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

Talking like a headstrong mamma
Got a picture in your wallet
Making me a habit, wearing your vintage t-shirt
Tied ribbons on your top hat
Telling me I'm all that, just like the girls from your hometown
Sweet blooded and up-stranded, see
If I can stand it, shrinking in the shallow water

Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now

You took to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else
You got me talking in my sleep
I don't wanna come back down
I don't wanna touch the ground
Pacific Ocean, dug so deep
Hypnotic taking over me

White threads on my laces, stuck on the hinges
Swinging the door to the backyard
Cut splinters, walk a tightrope
Spun like a bandage touch on the outer surface
Bright eyes of the solstice wherever your mind is headed
For a freight train city
Locked up till you're moonlit
Brushing my hair back, feeling your lips on my cold neck

Magnetic everything about you
You really got me, now

You took to me so well
Hypnotic taking over me
Make me feel like someone else

Hypnotic taking over meLost in the cracks of the landslide
You saw me slipping on my blind side
I'm feeling lost, feeling tongue-tied
And now I'm frozen in your headlights
Deep in the haze of your love high
I used to soar on the live-wire
I'm coming down from your supply
And I don't know if you can make right

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Shot through the cracks of the earthquake
My body's moving into retrograde
I'm feeling loose, feeling untamed
And you're the dynamite in my chains
Deep in the trench of the cross-fire
You shot me down from the live-wire
Tossed to the loss in your love game
You beat me cheating, ch-cheating and now I can't play

I can't take it
From the day I saw my heart start breaking
No one saved me
I can't take it, can't believe I really lost you, baby
Earth keeps shaking all around
Oh, you let me down
And I can't take it
From the days that my heart start breaking
No one saved me

Hit the ground running up from you
Baby, you know I don't want to
Know I want you but there's nothing left to say
Lost in the riddle you gave me
Caught in the middle, you played me
See so plainly
But there's nothing left to say

Each time makes it easier to ignore

Told to look an act a way, as if I'm just a ball of clay
That you can just mold into whatever, I assure you that's not clever
See now fads don't last forever they are fleeting like the weather
And we will stand our ground while you will sink and drown
Hahaha!
'Cause I'm a tough girl, I run my own world
And if you don't like it there's the door
If you haven't heard I ain't got no interest in your business
Just here for the music and there's nothing else to this bullshit!
Woah-oh-oh oh cause

Not here to lose
Not here for you to choose how we, should be
Cause we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine
We're not, we're not part, we're not part of your machine, noJust a young gun with the quick fuse

Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the back seat

I cannot give you everything, you know I wish I could

Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
We could turn around, or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is raging against us now
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down
But we took the step, and we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here

We're walking the wire, love
We're walking the wire, love
We're gonna be higher, up
We're walking the wire, wire, wire

There's nights we had that just walk away
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
You take me to the top I'm ready for
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible

Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily
Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

Whatever it takes

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit

Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I amWhen the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

When the curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don't want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide

Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hideIf you love somebody
Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose

The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (come on, come on, baby)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane

Rock you like a hurricane

It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?

The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (come on, come on, come on, come on)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am[Chorus]
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!

Stand clear!  Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out!  We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say "see ya"
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer?  You wicked overseer!
Ya hotshot, want to get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you want to follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police!

[Chorus]

Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word "overseer," like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patrolling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Chorus]

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the see-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great, when it's gonna stop?!

[Chorus]No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like
To be hated
To be faded to telling only lies

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No one knows what its like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

Behind blue eyes

It's just another year
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight
"One step at a time", they say

But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me

Give me strength to fight
Help me feel alive again
Make me whole inside
Instead, this hole inside is killing me
And I'm begging you

If I recover, will you take me back again?
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But my photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was meDon't throw stones at me
Don't tell anybody
Trouble finds me
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief

I'm going back to my roots

I keep on praying to see the light, oh

Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep
To the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know
You're all I know
When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know
You're all I know

Do you know
Do you know
You're all I know

When everything
Comes crashing down
You're all I know

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to
Drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold
And crumble away

Mama blessed me with magnet eyes for purple
Oh so let me show you something good

Pastor, preacher, I want to say I'm sorry
Nice to meet you, I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only

Auntie Mara, I think you know my reasons

To me

You could see
The darkest place that you could be
Oh maybe then you'd understand
From desert heat to cobbled streets
From broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know

So take me back
When I believed
Back when I was unafraid
Just like a thief
And all the heights
That I could reach
Back when I was unafraid
Just like a thief

If I could live a thousand times
If I could make a thousand tries
Maybe then I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know
That everyone just wants a show
No we don't want to see the truth

So take me back

And watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play

In youth you'd lay
Awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream!

You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating

Get out of the middle

So yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah4 A.M. beside myself
And what I think of mental health
All the things that worry me
All the things you don't believe
I've been told just what to do
Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be
I think I learned in therapy
Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you, it comes back to you
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you
It comes back to you, it comes back to you
Looking back into the past and I can see it through
(Tu lu tu tu tu du tu du tu tu)
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes back to you

Mocking birds and diamond rings
Oh I have thought of greater things
All the things that fly by me
All the lives that I could lead
Maybe I was born for that
Or maybe I was first to last
You could call it cowardliness
But leave me to my studied bliss
Am I just a shadow you drew?

It comes back to you, it comes back to you
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you
It comes back to you, it comes back to you
Looking back into the past and I can see it through
(Tu lu tu tu tu du tu du tu tu)
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back you oh oh
It comes to back youIn the dark
And I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw

We all are living in a dream,

Leave me to dream

In the eyes
Of a teenage crystallized
Oh the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

We all are living in a dream,

Up in the evening,
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.
Oh, to me.

Up on the mountain,
Down in the king's lair,
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.
Oh, afternoon.

We were never welcome here,
We were never welcome here at all.
No.

It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.

Save us,
What we are,
Don't look clear,
It's all uphill from here.
Ooh.

Up in the attic,
Down in the cellar,
Lost in a static,
Coming back for more.
Oh, for more.

Out with the reason,
In with the season,
Taking down names in my book of jealousy.
Jealousy.

We were never welcome here.
We were never welcome here at all.
No.

It's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.
Because it's who we are.
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.

Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I never have to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

Nobody else, nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higherSo this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I amWhen the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

Curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hideIf you love somebody
Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you move it

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey

Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey

Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down
Well, these days you're fine

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short

I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up shortTry to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice

Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe

Every night every night every night every night

I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your head
It ruffles you up
You could find the reason
You could let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
I'm coming home to you

My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

Searching to find myself
And all I find is you
I could hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?

No matter, no matter
No matter what we're facing
It don't matter, it don't matter
'Cause the reason that I'm here
Is the same through all these years
Not changing, not changing anything at all

Say if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Say if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out

Shake itI took a walk on a Saturday night,
Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Hate is gone and money's tight
This little home that I'm living in

You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you
Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you

Hey

We are all living
Till we grow older
You'll be the worker
I'll be the soldier

Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling
Now let me hear those sounds you sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling

I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?

You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them

Oh oh oh, what is with you?
Oh oh oh, I've never seen this side of you

Hey

We are all living

Cha ching, cha ching, cha chingaling

(Till we're older)Run for cover, my sense of fear is running thin
Undercover, just like a candle in the wind

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Every morning, I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh good morning, will you just wait until I die?

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming

Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Tell everybody, tell everybody
Tell everybody, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallenWe are all living the same way
We are escaping the same way
Circling
We are a part of the same play
We think we're making our own way
Circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction
Building a case for eviction
Circling
Guarding a tower of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience
And patiently circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don't have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is forIn the latest midnight hour

You gotta get up

Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

I cleanse in the river for somebody else,

To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve

This is my heart, it's on the line, SeleneThere's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh the jury stole my fame
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down

Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight
Oh did you think we'd cry
Oh can you feel my heart
I think I feel it too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight
Oh did you think we'd die

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies it to the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight

When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town

And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide

Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide

Curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you've made

Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth

No matter what we breed

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide

Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide

Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers

I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie

You can leave, now it's your choice

Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out

When the hour is nigh

To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we falling
We fall, we fallingI took a walk on a Saturday night,
Fog in the air,
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air,
Shaking hands run through my hair,
My fears, where do I go from here?

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Walking down to the waters edge,
Asking why I'm here instead of home,
Now I stand alone.
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it's side
With his
Like you were here with me.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Oh it's on the wall, it's loud,
It's in the brightest light,
It's when the world is moving.
Oh it's in the faintest cry,
It's in the lovers' eye,
It's when I need you most,
And don't you know,

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.

Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other,
We've been missing each other.We are all living the same way
We are escaping the same way
Circling
We are a part of the same play
We think we're making our own way
Circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

We are afflicted by fiction
Building a case for eviction
Circling
Guarding a tower of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience
And patiently circling

You don't have to hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for

All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don't have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

Round and round
I won't run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I'm not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is forIn the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody elseIs this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you

To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous

Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I go down to the grave and die happily

One LoveA sad story, might find it boring
Lost his mum to a drug named Heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy f*ck
Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grow out of it

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds
A small west, small things
Make the small things feel so tall
Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case
Oh, I couldn't ever say

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

But wait my life's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt, a few fights
Now kicked out clubs, shit the suns up
One look's all it took for his girl to cuss at another
Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fists
And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit other man is dead

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

And now he's locked away
Twenty-one years of age
How many lives must go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change
And I don't even know how
We continue to
Fight one another now

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
 
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
'Cause he ran out of luck, out of luckOh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears and
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, no, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
And now you know, you're free to go

Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been askin' for 
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the worlds inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin' for 
Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems

So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise, tearin' at the seams
I wish I could escape it, no, I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be
Believe me this one time
Believe me

I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

Please believe me, please believe meWelcome to the land of fire
I hope you brought the right attire
The crippled man is waiting at the door

He said "your eyes are much too bright"
The things you say are never right
The sins of all the world lie on your head

So when you see me look the other way
Cause -ohoh- lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say "come with me"

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take us in, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home I think he died

The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed

So when you see me look the other way
Cause lately all i do is say
These the plans i make believe all come with me

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take us in, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body

Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take us in, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my bodySay goodbye to all your friends
They will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it

When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)
Leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean itThere's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on

It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh the jury stole my fame
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down

It's all I want it's all we want tonight

Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight

Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies it to the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams

Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonightShe barely knew your name
He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing
Running from the country, she needed out but
He held that diamond ring

Cause I can't sit oh I cant talk
I gotta leave this town and run to you

He was such a worry
No need to hurry

But love was all she knew
Screaming out in agony she gave her life for you

Oh after I know, after it I want this song 
To love with someone watching over me
Rain or storm, the only ṗlace 
I wanna be is close to the heart of everything I even need
Life is not frightening when you are with me
Oh cause love is not always what you think it'll be

Love, oh love is strange, oh-oh-oh
When there's beauty on the inside
The outside there's nothing to ch-ch-ch-change

Strange love, strange love for one-another
Strange love, strange love for one-another
Can't judge a book by its cover
Strange love, strange love for one-another

Love, love is strange, oh-oh-oh
When there's beauty on the inside
The outside there's nothing to ch-ch-ch-change
Life is not frightening when you are with me
Oh cause love is not always what you think it'll be

Love, love is strange, oh-oh-oh
When there's beauty on the inside
The outside there's nothing to ch-ch-ch-change

Strange love, strange love for one-another
Strange love, strange love for one-another
Can't judge a book by its cover
Strange love, strange love for one-another

Strange love, strange love for one-another
Strange love, strange love for one-another
Can't judge a book by its cover
Strange love, strange love for one-anotherI use to feel so strange
In my skin I was shaking
I'd paint my room all black
And cover up all the walls

If you could rearrange what you saw in the mirror
Well tell me 
What would you change about the person you saw?

And honestly, honestly
If you just promise me, promise me

To stay forever
Never ever leave my side 
If the sun never rolls again 
The moon will light the way, my friend
So stay forever
You're my only friend tonight
All we need is the shock of love
In the dark
We are electric hearts

I use to feel so stuck 
In my head, I was breaking
I keep my secrets close
And never tell anyone
If you can dream all day
And coexist with living
My baby
I'd dream of us 
And all the battles we've won

And honestly, honestly
If you just promise me, promise me

To stay forever
Never ever leave my side 
If the sun never rolls again 
The moon will light the way, my friend
So stay forever
You're my only friend tonight
All we need is the shock of love
In the dark
We are electric hearts

Life is the risk you take
Life is the love you make
Love is the great escape

I've never felt a thing quite like it 
Dares me to move different
Talk different
Sing louder
Kick higher
You and I are intrepid 
One in the same
Never leave me
Never fade

So stay forever 
Never ever leave my side 
If the sun never rolls again 
The moon will light the way, my friend
So stay forever
You're my only friend tonight
All we need is the shock of love
In the dark
We are electric hearts
We are electric heartsI can not pretend that I wasn’t
The boy that met you standing by the lamp
Well I turned and ran for good
And hid out under my bed and waited there
For the sun to come back out 

Shivers down my back
Messages sent by my heart that understands
The sensitive nature of a boy inside a man
Is it safe to come out and show myself to you just yet?
What’re my chances? 

You don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me 

Tears ran down her face
And trapped her hair between the lips that parted winds
I’m polar she’s tropic
I’m a boy inside a man
Is it safe to come out and show myself to you just yet?
What’re my chances? 

You don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me 

You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand me
You, you don’t understand meThere are things you’ll never learn
Like there’s nothing to hide from
House of people at your door
Give it away they’ll just take more
But I don’t know what you want
But I can’t get it out of my brain
Yeah you’re almost there

There are things you’ll never do
Like even try to hurt me too
God knows something more than ruin
Put your down and cleans my moods
All this talk of swear and can’t get it out of my brain
Yeah you’re almost there
Yeah you’re almost thereUnder the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins, and warlords
Come out the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around
And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows

I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again

Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones
And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right

I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again

The moon is full, the air is still
All of the sudden I feel a chain
Victor is grinning, flesh is rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day
And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout

I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet cemetery
I don't want to live my life again, oh, no, oh, no
I don't want to live my life, not again, oh, no, oh, oh
I don't want to live my life, not again, oh, no, no, no
Don't want to live my life, not againMaking my amends
A resurrection
The needle and the thread
I'll start with my hands

This is your salvation
Your reincarnation
I hear them snickering when they smile
This be my clockwork

With my hands
With my hands

Making my amends
Your broken pieces
Create the prototype
And bring you back to life

I wanna see you dance
And take my second chance
Don't care what they heard
Just be my clockwork

With my hands
With my hands

I can put you back together
With my own hands
This time I'll make it better, better, better
I'll make the people gather
To see what I've made
I'll raise you from the dead
'Cause I don't wanna be alone again

Wake up
(With my hands)
Wake up
(With my hands)
Wake up
(With my hands)
Wake up

I need a sign of life
To see a spark inside
Create the chemistry
To bring you back to me

It's a love electrical
Almost mechanical
Let them all run scared
Just be my best friend

I'll put you back together
With my own hands
This time I'll make it better, better, better
I'll make the people gather
To see what I've made
I'll raise you from the dead
'Cause I don't wanna be alone again

It's now or never
You're gonna wake up, change my fate again
Wake up
This time will be forever and ever and ever

Such a frail tether
Fight the clock hands
I'll raise you from the grave
'Cause I don't wanna be alone again

Wake up

I'll put you back together
With my own hands
This time I'll make it better, better, better
I'll make the people gather
To see what I've made
I'll raise you from the dead
'Cause I don't wanna be alone again

You're gonna wake up

Forever and ever and ever

Wake up

I'll raise you from the dead
'Cause I don't wanna be alone again

And may be gone, my love, to the grave
But I got a secret
(Got a secret)
Everybody’s got a secret something good should come from all the rain

Eww got caught in thought
Went to their heads, went to their feet
At second glance
I’m fixing a friend with friendly speech
I pay no mind, to what they think

If I don’t tell a soul then, who else shouldn’t mind?
And may be gone, my love, to the grave
But I got a secret
(Got a secret)
Everybody’s got a secret…something good should come from all the rain.

Somebody believe in me

But I got a secret (Got a secret)
Everybody’s got a secret
Something good should come from all the rainI lost my one and only friend
They say he's never coming back again
(I) hold on the hoe while I pull him from the grave
They say he's dead and gone and can't be saved

(Oh oh oh oh oh)

Lock the door and count to five
Metal along metal, lightning in a bottle

Oh, its alive - my mechanical friend (my mechanical friend)

My mechanical friend (my mechanical friend)Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
For this, the deaf will have to wait
My head, is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness
In my head

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh we, can make it, out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long, as you, are with me, friend

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause

No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
Cause you are all I am

Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost causeIt's nice to know that you're undergound
It's nice to know, never lost or found
And the hillside covers you through town
Snowflakes block the view and ground

Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
Woah, woah
Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me

It's nice to know that you'll never grow
It's nice to know deep beneath the snow
And the hillside covers you through town
Snowflakes block the view and ground

Ma, ma, ma, ma, come see
Woah, woah
Dad, dad, dad, dad, look at me
Woah, woah

It's nice to know that you're undergroundSave your breath
No need to tell me you're my friend
I'm not gonna fall for that again

This human heart
How many times can it be torn,
Before a superhero is born?

This angel has lost her wings
I'm building a monster
Beneath all the scars you see
I'm building a monsterThose fingers in my hair
That sly
Come hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would commonsense for it do?

'Cause it's witchcraft!
Wicked witchcraft
And although I know
It'a strictly taboo

When you arouse the need in me

My heart says "yes
Indeed" in me

Proceed with what you're lead in 'me to!
It's such an ancient pitch

But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you!Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in (oh oh oh oh)
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in (oh oh oh oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
If this problem lies in me

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

Can I clear my conscience,
If I'm different from the rest
Do I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made it's home inside (oh oh oh oh)

If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger

I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting strongerIn the morning light let my roots take flight
Watch me from above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

From your slanted view see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I never have to lie

I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

Nobody else, nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher

Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higherSo this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes
To ashes

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I am

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
I'm never changing who I amWhen the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold

When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood's run stale

I want to hide the truth
I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside
There's nowhere we can hide

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

When the curtain's call
Is the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl

So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made

Don't want to let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't want to hide the truth

No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide

They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go

Your eyes, they shine so bright
I want to save their light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how

When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
Don't get too close
It's dark inside
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hideIf you love somebody
Better tell them why they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you

You'll never know what went well
Then again it just depends on
How long of time is left for you

I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but not til you move it

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey
I'm on top of the world, 'ey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, 'ey
Been holding it in for a while, 'ey
Take it with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something

I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something

Now take it in but don't look down

'Cause I'm on top of the world, 'ey

And I know it's hard when you're falling down
And it's a long way up when you hit the ground
Get up now, get up, get up now

Well, these days I'm fine
No these days I tend to lie
I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down
Well, these days you're fine
No these days you tend to lie
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I keep coming up short

I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried

But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way

Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up shortTry to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice

Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You've got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away

Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
Can nobody hear me?
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your head
It ruffles you up
You could find the reason
You could let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

Searching to find myself
And all I find is you
I could hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?
You could find a reason
You could let me know
I won't blame you
I just didn't go

I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night
Coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I'm coming home to you
Every night every night every night every night

No matter, no matter
No matter what we're facing
It don't matter, it don't matter
'Cause the reason that I'm here
Is the same through all these years
Not changing, not changing anything at all

I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night every night every night every night
Coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night every night every night every night

My mind is made up
My feelings changed and
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)
Every night every night every night every nightI'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the day has come
But I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To feel they're not worth hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow

You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong

'Cause I'm bleeding out
Said if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)

I'll bleed out for you
So I bear my skin

I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but
Holding to the thought of another time, but
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

I don't want to do it just to do it for you

Cuffing season is officially here
Got the sound of counterfeits ringing strong in my ear
Curving 50 miles an hour and I can't even stress
Not the EBS but this is only a test
Now its dry in my DM's holiday's coming up
They say men are like a bus
Another one pulling up
Bio clock all in a rush
Zero zero in the crush
Heart is steady in a rush
So I'm like God
Yo what's up?

Why you single?
Cause I’m choosing to wait 
And I refuse to buss down with a man on a date 
Keeping my heart pure
Saving myself for the one
Like when Ephesians 5 man Meets his Proverbs 31 
God I’m trusting you and all
But these Judas’ is plotting on my fall
Many don’t even understand the call on my life 
Unmarried at the moment but God told me that I’m a wife
 
When you walk in the room
They should already know 
That you are God’s child 
And you ain’t nobody’s joke

A masterpiece forever broken at the end of the day

On both sides kept driving in front of me
Call me Steve Erkel
Man I got a ton of mistakes 
Did I do that?
I got people that still hate me today
Thank God for her 
I was down on my life before the gamble 
And low she made me sunny side up before I was scrambled 
I was lost but a Kingdom woman 
That’s where it’s at 
She partnered with me 
Took me high and she subs in the back
Was hardly perfect like a diamond
But it still made me rare
Just make this strive your 9 to 5 
A virtuous woman you will find 
Where she at?

This song is dedicated to my Christian single ladies 
Trying to do the right thing

Now where he at?

My man of God

Trying to be a good girl
Living in this cruel world
Not hear for your judgement
Cause I'm not that thirsty

They be like Jay 
Why they don’t make them like you in the states 
Tossing coins in wishing wells just to find one today 
Hey I’m not perfect 
I caught L’s like I’m riding the train 
Was in the belly of the whale 
When I said man okay
Trying to be perfect 
I’m Piccaso when he finish the paint 
A masterpiece forever broken at the end of the day 
Was Marques Houston Immature 
Like that single constantly 
But I had steering wheels 
On both sides kept driving in front of me
Call me Steve Erkel
Man I got a ton of mistakes 
Did I do that?
I got people that still hate me today
Thank God for her 
I was down on my life before the gamble 
And low she made me sunny side up before I was scrambled 
I was lost but a Kingdom woman 
That’s where it’s at 
She partnered with me 
Took me high and she subs in the back
Was hardly perfect like a diamond
But it still made me rare
Just make this strive your 9 to 5 
A virtuous woman you will find 
Where she at?

This song is dedicated to my Christian single ladies 
Trying to do the right thing 
While being patient
But I know Trusting God can sometimes be frustrating
But wait 
Isn’t God the author and finisher of your faith 
In due time
He will get the glory
If you let him write 
Your love story
